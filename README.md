# About

This program a simple dice roll simulator for the original version of the game
**Risk**. It saves you having to roll dice. It can simulate single attacks
(i.e., 3v2, 3v1, 2v2, 2v1, 1v2, and 1v1) or entire battles (e.g., 15v17) by
repeatedly simulating single attacks.

It is meant to present a simplified view. If replacing having to tediously roll
dice for each attack, just hitting the space bar will present a simulation for
all six single attack configurations.

This program will also report statistics about single attacks and entire
battles, if desired. Statistics are generated by simulation 10k attacks/battles.
Expected losses, winners, and the win rate are reported.
